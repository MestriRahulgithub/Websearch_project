                            <p>Sherlock Holmes is a fictional detective created by British author Arthur Conan Doyle.
                                Referring to himself as a "consulting detective" in the stories, Holmes is known for his
                                proficiency with observation, deduction, forensic science and logical reasoning that
                                borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety
                                of clients, including Scotland Yard.

                                First appearing in print in 1887's A Study in Scarlet, the character's popularity became
                                widespread with the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with
                                "A Scandal in Bohemia" in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927,
                                eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories. All but one[a] are set in the
                                Victorian or Edwardian eras, between about 1880 and 1914. Most are narrated by the
                                character of Holmes's friend and biographer Dr. John H. Watson, who usually accompanies
                                Holmes during his investigations and often shares quarters with him at the address of
                                221B Baker Street, London, where many of the stories begin.</p>

                            <p>Details of Sherlock Holmes's life in Conan Doyle's stories are scarce and often vague.
                                Nevertheless, mentions of his early life
                                and extended family paint a loose biographical picture of the detective.

                                A statement of Holmes's age in "His Last Bow" places his year of birth at 1854; the
                                story, set in August 1914, describes him as
                                sixty years of age. His parents are not mentioned, although Holmes mentions that his
                                "ancestors" were "country squires". In "The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter",
                                he claims that his grandmother was sister to the French artist Vernet, without
                                clarifying whether this was Claude Joseph, Carle, or Horace Vernet. Holmes's brother
                                Mycroft,
                                seven years his senior, is a government official. Mycroft has a unique civil service
                                position as a kind of human database for all aspects of government policy.
                                Sherlock describes his brother as the more intelligent of the two, but notes that
                                Mycroft lacks any interest in physical investigation, preferring to spend his time at
                                the
                                Diogenes Club.

                                Holmes says that he first developed his methods of deduction as an undergraduate; his
                                earliest cases, which he pursued as an amateur, came from fellow university students.
                                A meeting with a classmate's father led him to adopt detection as a profession.</p>

                            <p>n the first Holmes tale, A Study in Scarlet, financial difficulties lead Holmes and
                                Dr. Watson to share rooms together at 221B Baker Street, London.[26] Their residence is
                                maintained by
                                their landlady, Mrs. Hudson.[27] Holmes works as a detective for twenty-three years,
                                with Watson assisting
                                him for seventeen of those years.[28] Most of the stories are frame narratives written
                                from Watson's
                                point of view, as summaries of the detective's most interesting cases. Holmes frequently
                                calls Watson's records
                                of Holmes's cases sensational and populist, suggesting that they fail to accurately and
                                objectively report the "science" of his craft:</p>

                                        Conan Doyle (1859–1930), Sherlock Holmes's creator, in 1914</div>

                            <p>Edgar Allan Poe's C. Auguste Dupin is generally acknowledged as the first detective in
                                fiction and served as the prototype
                                for many later characters, including Holmes.[8] Conan Doyle once wrote, "Each [of Poe's
                                detective stories] is a root from which a whole
                                literature has developed ... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath
                                of life into it?"
                                Similarly, the stories of Émile Gaboriau's Monsieur Lecoq were extremely popular at the
                                time Conan Doyle began writing Holmes,
                                and Holmes's speech and behaviour sometimes follow those of Lecoq.[10][11] Doyle has his
                                main characters discuss these literary
                                antecedents near the beginning of A Study in Scarlet, which is set soon after Watson is
                                first introduced to Holmes. Watson attempts to compliment Holmes by comparing him to
                                Dupin,
                                to which Holmes replies that he found Dupin to be "a very inferior fellow" and Lecoq to
                                be "a miserable bungler".</p>

                                the 1920s for Sherlock Holmes. He was the only fictional character
                                so honoured, along with eminent Britons such as Lord Byron, Benjamin Disraeli, and
                                Florence Nightingale.

                                A number of London streets are associated with Holmes. York Mews South, off Crawford
                                Street, was renamed Sherlock Mews, and Watson's Mews is near Crawford Place.
                                The Sherlock Holmes is a public house in Northumberland Street in London which contains
                                a large collection of memorabilia related to Holmes, the original collection having been

                                for display in Baker Street during the Festival of Britain in 1951.
